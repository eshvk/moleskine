No concept of external url for post. Each post has a date in the header.
There is an assumption that this partial is included somewhere that defines
page, root_url and content. page.url is relative. Note that when this include
is called by a template, the way Jekyll works is that it defines a 'page' and a
'site' object. The 'page' object stands for both a 'post' and a 'page'. This is
why the variable name is so.

<article>
	<header>
		<h1><a href="{{ root_url }}{{ page.url }}">{{ page.title }}</a></h1>
		<time>{{ page.date | date: "%d %B %Y" }}</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			{{ content }}
