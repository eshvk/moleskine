Octopress theme for my site. Easy on my eyes. Largely based on pageturner and
cleanpress themes. Code commented verbosely to make sense to me.  


TODO 
----

1. Figure out how to have categories. 
2. Connect Flickr account for pictures. 
3. Take the font and width from pageturner theme. 
4. Take the idea of having a portfolio from cleanpress. 
5. Use LSI to generate similar posts.
