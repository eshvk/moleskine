Octopress theme for my site. Easy on my eyes. Largely based on [pageturner][pt] and
[cleanpress][clp] themes. Code commented verbosely to make sense to me.  

features
-------

- Clean layout. Based on pageturner. 
- Fancybox, flickr integrations. Based on too many sources. Look at my gists ([here][gist1] and [here][gist2] for further integration.)
- MathJax. 


TODO 
----

- Why have archives? Why not categories? 
- A portfolio? look at [skedasis][skedasis] for ideas. 
- What else needs to taken from the old theme? 
- Some analytics tool? Google analytics, mixpanel? do I care?  
- Coding style. Look at [d3][d3site]
