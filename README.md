Octopress theme for my site. Easy on my eyes. Largely based on pageturner and
cleanpress themes. Code commented verbosely to make sense to me.  

features
-------

- Clean layout. Based on pageturner. 
- Fancybox, flickr integrations. Based on too many sources. Look at my gists
  for further integration. 
- MathJax. 


TODO 
----

1. Why have archives? Why not categories? 
2. A portfolio? look at skedasis for ideas. 
3. What else needs to taken from the old theme?
