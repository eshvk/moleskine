Octopress theme for my site. Easy on my eyes. Largely based on pageturner and
cleanpress themes. Code commented verbosely to make sense to me.  


TODO 
----

1. How to have categories. 
2. Does a twitter feed make sense? 
3. Change the angry red lines over links. 
4. Simple Javascript support
5. A portfolio? look at skedasis for ideas. 
6. Salvage more from the old theme (mathjax etc)
